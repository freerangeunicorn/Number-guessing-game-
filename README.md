# Number-guessing-game-

This is my number generator!
Hope you'll have lots of fun playing with it.

The following required functionalities are completed:

The user can attempt to guess a random integer between 1 and 100 by entering a value into a textbox.
The user can press a button to check their guess, and receive feedback on whether their guess was too low, too high, or correct.
 
The user sees feedback about the most recent guess in a Bootstrap alert class div. If the guess is correct, the user will see a div styled with the "success" background.
The user is limited to ten guesses to guess the correct number, and can see the number of remaining guesses after each incorrect guess via a "Guesses Remaining" area.
